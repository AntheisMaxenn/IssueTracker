# IssueTracker
 IssueTrackerWEB_API_Project

 The backend of my IssueTracker Project. It has all the functionality you would be expect from any backend and implements as many features/technologies as examples, that were practical. Swagger has been intentionally left on while in Production/Deployment, for ease of demonstration. The Angular Frontend is in development and after completetion, the features and development of the Project will continue. The repo contains a UML that will help when testing with the Swagger interface.
